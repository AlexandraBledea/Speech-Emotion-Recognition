# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

I took from the internet the methods for data augmentation and the model for the network. (The creation part of the model, not includint the training and validation part). I adjusted the model to work with Mean Square Error loss function and Categorical Cross Entropy loss function, and modified the drop out change to 0.2, because like that it worked better on my dataset.
The rest of the code I wrote my self.
